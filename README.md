# Sonata

###### Sonata combines both software and hardware to wake up its user without using any sound. This device uses both Android and Arduino to achieve its goal. It allows communication by signals via a microcontroller. This microcontroller then uses a light sensor, and depending on the current signal, it will gauge the brightness of the room. Using this information, it will adjust the timer and brightness of LED lights that will awake the user "naturally." 

- Arduino source code works concurrently with the android code. 
- Android app works with the bluetooth module on the Arduino and sends it signals.
- A light sensor was also used.
